- **Diastolic blood pressure:** 66.0 mm Hg
- **Triceps skin fold thickness:** 29.0 mm
- **2-Hour serum insulin:** 0.0 mu U/ml
- **Body Mass Index (BMI):** 26.6
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function:** 0.351
- **Age:** 31.0 years

#### Analysis of Each Measurement:

1. **Number of Times Pregnant:**
   - **Measurement:** 1.0
   - **Significance:** While pregnancy can be a risk factor for gestational diabetes, the number of pregnancies alone doesn't strongly predict the onset of Type 2 diabetes. However, it may contribute to overall risk profiling in conjunction with other factors.

2. **Plasma Glucose Concentration (2 hours post OGTT):**
   - **Measurement:** 85.0 mg/dL
   - **Significance:** This value is significantly below the diabetic threshold of 200 mg/dL and even below the prediabetic range of 140-199 mg/dL, indicating normal glucose tolerance at this time point.

3. **Diastolic Blood Pressure:**
   - **Measurement:** 66.0 mm Hg
   - **Significance:** This value is within the normal diastolic range (normal: 60-80 mm Hg). High blood pressure is a risk factor for diabetes complications, but normal blood pressure reduces this risk.

4. **Triceps Skin Fold Thickness:**
   - **Measurement:** 29.0 mm
   - **Significance:** Skin fold thickness is used to estimate body fat. This value falls within a typical range but needs to be considered in tandem with BMI to get a complete picture.

5. **2-Hour Serum Insulin:**
   - **Measurement:** 0.0 mu U/ml
   - **Significance:** Zero serum insulin post OGTT can be alarming and might suggest insulin deficiency or severe insulin resistance. This low level could potentially be a significant indicator of diabetes, although needs more clinical corroboration.

6. **Body Mass Index (BMI):**
   - **Measurement:** 26.6
   - **Significance:** This BMI falls into the ‘Overweight’ category (25-29.9). Being overweight is a risk factor for developing diabetes, particularly in conjunction with other risk factors. 

7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function:**
   - **Measurement:** 0.351
   - **Significance:** This function factors in family history of diabetes. A value of 0.351 does indicate some familial risk, although it’s not particularly high. The higher the value, the greater the genetic predisposition.

8. **Age:**
   - **Measurement:** 31.0 years
   - **Significance:** Age 31 is relatively young. While age itself is not a strong independent risk factor at this stage, any additional risk factors would contribute more significantly to the likelihood of developing diabetes as the patient ages.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the given measurements, the primary areas of concern are the 2-hour serum insulin level of 0.0 mu U/ml and the slightly overweight BMI of 26.6. While other indicators like glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, and family history do not raise immediate red flags, the serum insulin level warrants further investigation. This value could indicate an underlying issue with insulin production or secretion, or potentially severe insulin resistance. 

Recommendation for the patient would be to:
1. **Consult a healthcare provider** for further testing, particularly focusing on fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels to assess long-term glucose control.
2. **Perform a comprehensive endocrinological evaluation** to understand the insulin dynamics and potentially catch early-onset diabetes or a prediabetic state.
3. **Monitor and manage body weight** through a balanced diet and regular physical activity, aiming to bring the BMI into a normal range.

Maintaining regular check-ups and closely watching any symptoms can provide a clearer picture and contribute toward a preventive strategy against diabetes.
